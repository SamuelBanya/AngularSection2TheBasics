* Initial Notes For Setting Up Projects
One thing to keep in mind:
- Always make sure you add 'bootstrap' to each subsequent project with the following steps:
npm install --save bootstrap 

Then, go to the 'angular.json' file, go to projects > architect > build > styles, and make sure the following line is added:
    "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",

* Databinding Notes
Typescript Code -> Template (HTML)

--> Output Data:
- String Interpolation ( {{ data }})
- Property Binding ([property]="data")

<-- React To (User) Events
- Event Binding ((event)="expression")

Combination Of Both:
- Two-Way-Binding ([(ngModel)]="data")
