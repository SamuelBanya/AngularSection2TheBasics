One thing to keep in mind:
- Always make sure you add 'bootstrap' to each subsequent project with the following steps:
npm install --save bootstrap 

Then, go to the 'angular.json' file, go to projects > architect > build > styles, and make sure the following line is added:
    "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
