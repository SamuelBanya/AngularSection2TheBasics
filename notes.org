* Initial Notes For Setting Up Projects
One thing to keep in mind:
- Always make sure you add 'bootstrap' to each subsequent project with the following steps:
npm install --save bootstrap 

Then, go to the 'angular.json' file, go to projects > architect > build > styles, and make sure the following line is added:
    "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",

* Databinding Notes
Typescript Code -> Template (HTML)

--> Output Data:
- String Interpolation ( {{ data }})
- Property Binding ([property]="data")

<-- React To (User) Events
- Event Binding ((event)="expression")

Combination Of Both:
- Two-Way-Binding ([(ngModel)]="data")


* Notes On Constructor Functions 
- The 'constructor' is the function that is executed when the component is created in Angular:

* How To Allow Databinding To Properties 
- We can bind to HTML properties of tags, like 'disabled', etc
- You have to add '[]' around the property itself to dynamically bind the property
- Ex: You can add a '[disabled]' property to disable a button accordingly
