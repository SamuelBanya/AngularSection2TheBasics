* Constructor
- NOTE: I am pretty sure this was covered earlier, but it's good as a review
- This is a function that basically is called upon creation of an Angular component

* Directives 
** 'ngIf' Directive
'*ngIf':
- These are in-built directives that allow you change the appearance or behavior of DOM elements and Angular components 
- Related Docs page: 
- https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives
- For '*ngIf': the '*' is required since it is a structural directive that changes the structure of the DOM of the page, ex: It either adds or doesn't add the element that '*ngIf' is attached to

** '<ng-template>' Directive
'<ng-template>': This is a directive that is native to Angular which allows you to mark places in the DOM

** Attribute Directive
- In the example for this lesson, we binded to the 'ngStyle' directive
- However, we want to bind to a property on the directive called 'ngStyle'

* What Was Done in The '39. Styling Elements Dynamically with ngStyle' Lesson:
- We added the following in the 'src/app/server/server.component.html' file:
#+BEGIN_SRC html 
<p [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: getColor()}">{{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }} </p>
#+END_SRC
- I then added the corresponding 'getColor' function within the 'src/app/server/server.component.ts' file to return a ternary expression accordingly:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
    getColor() {
        return this.serverStatus === 'online' ? 'green' : 'red';
    }
#+END_SRC

* What Was Done In The '40. Applying CSS Classes Dynamically with ngClass' Lesson:
- I modified the 'src/app/server/server.component.ts' file with the following 'styles' tag:
#+BEGIN_SRC js 
@Component({
    selector: 'app-server',
    templateUrl: './server.component.html',
    styles: [`
        .online {
            color: white;
        }
    `]
})
#+END_SRC

- I then had to use the 'ngClass' directive, but also used corresponding property binding within the 'src/app/server/server.component.html' file that checks to see if the 'serverStatus' variable is set to 'online':
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<p 
    [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: getColor()}"
    [ngClass]="{online: serverStatus === 'online'}">
    {{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }} 
</p>
#+END_SRC

* How To Use The 'ngFor' Directive To Loop Through To Add Components To A Page 
- You can use the 'ngFor' directive to loop through and add components:
- Within the 'servers.component.ts' file, I added a new array:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
export class ServersComponent {
  allowNewServer = false;
  serverCreationStatus = 'No server was created!';
  // NOTE: This was for the previous one-way databinding example:
  // serverName = '';
  serverName = "TestServer";
  serverCreated = false;
  servers = ['TestServer', 'TestServer 2'];
#+END_SRC
- I then used .push in the same 'servers.component.ts' file within the 'onCreateServer' function:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
  onCreateServer() {
    // NOTE: We are setting 'serverCreated' to true for later use with the '*ngIf' directive:
    this.serverCreated = true;
    this.servers.push(this.serverName);
#+END_SRC
