* Constructor
- NOTE: I am pretty sure this was covered earlier, but it's good as a review
- This is a function that basically is called upon creation of an Angular component

* Directives 
** 'ngIf' Directive
'*ngIf':
- These are in-built directives that allow you change the appearance or behavior of DOM elements and Angular components 
- Related Docs page: 
- https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives
- For '*ngIf': the '*' is required since it is a structural directive that changes the structure of the DOM of the page, ex: It either adds or doesn't add the element that '*ngIf' is attached to

** '<ng-template>' Directive
'<ng-template>': This is a directive that is native to Angular which allows you to mark places in the DOM

** Attribute Directive
- In the example for this lesson, we binded to the 'ngStyle' directive
- However, we want to bind to a property on the directive called 'ngStyle'

* What Was Done in The '39. Styling Elements Dynamically with ngStyle' Lesson:
- We added the following in the 'src/app/server/server.component.html' file:
#+BEGIN_SRC html 
<p [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: getColor()}">{{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }} </p>
#+END_SRC
- I then added the corresponding 'getColor' function within the 'src/app/server/server.component.ts' file to return a ternary expression accordingly:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
    getColor() {
        return this.serverStatus === 'online' ? 'green' : 'red';
    }
#+END_SRC
